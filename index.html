	<h2> Other things to note: </h2>
	<p> I'm 31, originally from Sweden and moved to New York 6 years ago. Before coming here I also lived in New Zealand for a couple of years. I'm attending Dev Bootcamp this summer in hopes of becoming a web developer. I already have some experience working with graphic and web design but I want to be able to build things that do stuff! And not just any stuff... cool stuff! I was thinking about going down the UX path and I'm not writing that off because I find the point where psychology, technology and marketing meet really interesting but I want to know how to build applications and not <em> just </em> design them. </p>

<h2 class="diff"> A similar page </h2>
<p class="diff"> I guess this site is kind of like a blog / About me / portfolio and I found <a href="http://www.gummisig.com/about" target="_blank">this site</a>, for a freelance designer that has a similar purpose. I'm focusing on his About me page and portfolio as that's kind of what i've got going on here. I like the big type, and the background image makes it look way more interesting than if it was a plain background. The nav menu is cool too with the type overlapping a bit. I don't like the way he styled the links. Makes it look old. Just plain orange without the background color would look good. I'm not a big fan of the work page as the squares with the text under each and the bold border on hover makes it look stale. I think a text overlay would be nicer and maybe just do a shadow on hover could be more subtle. The site is also not very responsive.  </p>
